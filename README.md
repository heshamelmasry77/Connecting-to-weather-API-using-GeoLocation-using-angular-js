It is a simple angular application to connect to the REST Weather API api and and lookup the weather conditions
for the current location.

The project is generated using yeomen and been edited to suitable my needs. 
To run the project:

I used angular geolocation to get current cordinates  which you can find it here

https://github.com/arunisrael/angularjs-geolocation

Make sure you have these globally installed
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
 	- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

The application is divided to modules and components
and because we have one module which is main so i you will see main folder:
main folder:
filters
modals
services
maincontroller
my view

Navigate to the project then : 
* simply Clone > git clone
* CD to the folder cd global-kinetic-test
* Run > npm install` to install the project dependencies
* Run > bower install
* Run > gulp build 
* Run > gulp serve
